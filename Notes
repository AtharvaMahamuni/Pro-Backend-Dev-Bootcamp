    Majorly we use 4 types of web requests given above but there are more in the MDN documentation which can be found below.
    
    [https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Methods](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Methods)
    
- 04 Framework
    
    There are various frameworks on top of nodejs to work with web requests
    
    expressjs.com
    
    koajs.com
    
    sailsjs.com
    
    [hapi.dev](http://hapi.dev)
    
- 05 Starting with package JSON file
    
    There are 2 types of dependencies
    
    1. Major dependencies - Which we directly install and this are required for our application
    2. Dev dependencies - Which helps you at the development life cycle we delete them at the time of production `--save-dev`
    
    [Why, What and How of NPM](https://www.notion.so/Why-What-and-How-of-NPM-a59ffb539ed24bb58947c4f36a415085)
    
- 06 Your first express app
    - Now to create express app we installed the express in our system
    - Now we need to edit the scripts and start to nodemon index.js so that it becomes easier to start from there
    
    ![Untitled](https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/secure.notion-static.com/894a68a8-b8d8-4f0a-b972-5011a135a2b2/Untitled.png)
    
    - Now we can easily use `npm start` to start the continuous execution of app.
    - We installed nodemon with command `npm i nodemon -D` and it got installed as a dev dependency.
    
    ### Our first app will look something like this.

    express hello world example - [https://expressjs.com/en/starter/hello-world.html](https://expressjs.com/en/starter/hello-world.html)
    
    ```jsx
    const express = require('express');
    const app = express();
    
    const PORT = 4000 || process.env.PORT;
    
    // '/' is known as the root directory where we will see our response
    // req and res are 2 important objects req is a request and res is the reponse which we get
    // Here we got response as a Hello World! wrapped inside h1 tag.
    app.get('/', (req, res) => {
        res.send('<h1>Hello World!</h1>')
      });
    
    // With this we can listen response from the give port number.
    app.listen(PORT, () => {
        console.log(`Application is running on the port ${PORT}`);
    });
    ```
